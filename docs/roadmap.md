# Roadmap & phase status

Living status tracker for the phased plan in **[stratt-charter.md](../stratt-charter.md) §8**. The charter
is the authority on *what each phase is*; this file records *where we actually are* against it, with
evidence. Update it when a phase deliverable lands or a gate is met.

**Two things gate a phase, and they are different:**
- **Code deliverables** — the capabilities a phase ships. These are built here and verifiable in the repo.
- **Promote / OSS gates** — real-world conditions (daily-driver adoption, N-day zero-data-loss, an SLO
  window, a security review, going public with OSPO clearance). **Code cannot satisfy these** — they need
  operation, time, and org/legal steps. A phase can be "code-complete" while its exit gate is still open.

## Phase 0 — Spike ✅

The thesis slice. **Done** — go/no-go recorded in [ADR-0008](adr/0008-phase0-go-no-go-measurements.md).

| Deliverable | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Entity/Facet/Provenance store | ✅ | `core/internal/graph` (migration `00001_graph_spine`) |
| One native Syncer (vCenter-class) | ✅ | `core/internal/connectors/vcenter` ([ADR-0007](adr/0007-phase0-syncer-sdk-and-dev-harness.md)) |
| View query → Temporal Workflow → K8s Job (ansible-runner) | ✅ | `orchestrate`, `dispatch`, `actuators/ansible` |
| Facts projected back with provenance | ✅ | `graph.RunProjector`, `orchestrate.ProjectFacts` |
| Live SSE tail | ✅ | `events.Bus.Tail`, `GET /runs/{id}/events` |

## Phase 1 — Usable core 🔶 (code ✅ · exit gate 🚫)

**Code-complete.** The promote gate (Nebulae daily-driver, 30 days zero data loss) and the **OSS gate
(repo public with DCO/ADRs/quickstart)** are **not met** — the repo stays private until OSPO/IP clearance
(charter §7.4, the highest project risk). So Phase-1 *work* is done; its exit gate is blocked.

| Deliverable | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Ansible Actuator (EEs, per-target results, slicing) | ✅ | `actuators/ansible`, `RunInput.Slices` |
| `script` Actuator | ✅ | `actuators/script` |
| Git desired-state sync + `stratt apply`/`plan` | ✅ | `desiredstate`, `POST /desired-state/{plan,apply}` |
| Views UI | ✅ | `ui/` ([ADR-0012](adr/0012-views-ui-v1.md)) |
| Workflows + Gates | ✅ | `orchestrate.RunDAG`, `DecideGate` ([ADR-0011](adr/0011-workflows-gates-v1.md)) |
| Schedules | ✅ | `triggers`, Temporal Schedules ([ADR-0010](adr/0010-triggers-v1-schedules.md)) |
| CredentialRefs (Vault + K8s) | ✅ | `dispatch.CredentialMount` ([ADR-0009](adr/0009-identity-authz-credential-brokering.md)) |
| OIDC + basic OpenFGA | ✅ | `authz` (OpenFGA + tuples), OIDC resolver |
| Helm chart | ✅ | `deploy/charts/stratt` ([ADR-0013](adr/0013-helm-packaging.md)) |
| MS Graph + cloud-instance Syncers | ✅ | `connectors/msgraph`, `connectors/awsec2` ([ADR-0014](adr/0014-connector-breadth-msgraph-ec2.md)) |
| **Promote:** Nebulae daily-driver, 30d zero data loss | ⬜ | operational, not code |
| **OSS gate:** OSPO clearance → repo public (DCO/ADRs/quickstart) | 🚫 | charter §7.4 blocker |

## Phase 2 — Seams + intent layer ✅ (code)

**Code-complete.**

| Deliverable | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| OpenTofu Actuator (plan/apply Gates, encrypted HTTP state backend, output→Contracts) | ✅ | `actuators/opentofu`, `statebackend` ([ADR-0016](adr/0016-opentofu-actuator.md)/[0017](adr/0017-tofu-outputs-to-entities.md)) |
| Trigger engine (webhook + Alertmanager Emitters, CEL) | ✅ | `triggerengine`, `emitters`, `rules` ([ADR-0018](adr/0018-trigger-engine.md)) |
| Intent/Assignment/Blueprint compiler (claim types, ownership registry, membership-delta, max-delta gate) | ✅ | `compiler` ([ADR-0023](adr/0023-intent-compiler.md)) |
| Baselines + Findings v1 (check-mode + tofu plan, flap damping) | ✅ | `baselines`, `graph.findingstore` ([ADR-0019](adr/0019-baselines-findings-v1.md)) |
| MCP actuator/Action adapter + platform MCP server | ✅ | `actuators/mcp`, `mcpserver` ([ADR-0021](adr/0021-platform-mcp-server.md)/[0022](adr/0022-mcp-actuator.md)) |
| AWX importer + `/api/v2` façade | ✅ | `awximport`, `awxfacade` ([ADR-0025](adr/0025-awx-importer-and-ansible-scm-content-ref.md)/[0026](adr/0026-awx-api-v2-facade.md)) |
| Notifications | ✅ | `notify` ([ADR-0027](adr/0027-notifications.md)) |

## Phase 3 — Enterprise + fleet 🔶 (code ~90% · gates 🚫)

Substantially built. Two Connectors are **deliberately deferred** (no current need or environment to
connect to — revisit when a real tenant requires them); the promote/OSS gates are open.

| Deliverable | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Sites (NATS leaf) | ✅ | `sitegw`, `siteproto`, `cmd/stratt-agent` ([ADR-0032](adr/0032-sites-remote-execution-loci.md)) |
| Full OpenFGA (View-scoped execution, use-without-read) | ✅ | `authz.RelationRunner`/`RelationUser` ([ADR-0028](adr/0028-view-scoped-execution-authz.md)) |
| HA + DR runbook | ✅ | [ADR-0040](adr/0040-high-availability-and-disaster-recovery.md), [runbooks/ha-dr.md](runbooks/ha-dr.md) |
| audit → SIEM sink | ✅ | `forwarder`, `cmd/stratt-forwarder` ([ADR-0034](adr/0034-audit-stream-and-siem-forwarder.md)) |
| SCIM | ✅ | `scim` ([ADR-0035](adr/0035-scim-service-provider.md)) |
| Pull agent + Bundles | ✅ | `cmd/stratt-agent` (pull), `bundle` ([ADR-0032](adr/0032-sites-remote-execution-loci.md)) |
| Evidence store (object-lock) + CIS pack | ✅ | `evidencestore`, `packs/cis` ([ADR-0029](adr/0029-evidence-store-object-lock.md)/[0033](adr/0033-cis-pack-compliance-as-data.md)) |
| `Intent/Certificate` + `Intent/FileSet` + `Intent/Access` GA | ✅ | `connectors/certissuer`, `types.Intent{Certificate,FileSet,Access}` ([ADR-0030](adr/0030-intent-certificate-ga.md)/[0036](adr/0036-intent-fileset-access-ga.md)) |
| **Jamf Connector** | ⏸ | deferred — no current need/environment |
| **ConfigMgr (SCCM AdminService) Connector** | ⏸ | deferred — no current need/environment |
| **Promote:** production for a bounded service class; 99.9% 30-day SLO; security review | ⬜ | operational, not code |
| **OSS gate:** v1.0; ≥2 external maintainers; ≥3 community plugins; CNCF Sandbox; vocabulary freeze | 🚫 | gated by §7.4 going-public |

## Phase 4 — Consolidation ⬜ (not started as a phase)

Cross-domain patch rings, self-service portal, cost analytics, Helm/Packer Actuators, ServiceNow push,
CRD interface, verified-plugin registry, ACP addressability. Not begun as planned Phase-4 work — **but see
below.**

---

## Ahead of the roadmap: multi-region Cells

The **[ADR-0044](adr/0044-control-plane-cells.md) Cells workstream (slices 1–7, complete)** delivers
multi-region active/active with fenced Source re-home — a capability the roadmap places at Phase 4 and
beyond. [ADR-0040](adr/0040-high-availability-and-disaster-recovery.md) explicitly *deferred* cells, and
the 99.99% multi-region target sits *above* Phase-3's 99.9% single-region SLO
([evidence map](evidence/multi-region-99_99.md)). Follow-up [ADR-0045](adr/0045-db-driven-syncer-home-gate.md)
(full re-home auto-cutover) is Proposed, not scheduled.

## Where we are, in one line

Phases 0–2 code-complete; Phase 3 code ~90% (Jamf + ConfigMgr Connectors deferred by choice); multi-region
Cells shipped ahead of schedule. **No phase's promote/OSS exit gate is met** — every one ultimately waits on
the charter §7.4 going-public step (OSPO/IP clearance) plus real operational evidence (SLO, security review,
adoption), none of which is a coding task.
